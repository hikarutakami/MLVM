A constraint-handling technique for evolutionary algorithms "More Less-Violations Method (MLVM)"

A comparator-based constraint handling technique referred as More Less-Violations Method (MLVM), proposed for evolutionary algorithms to solve real engineering constrained optimization problems, is a simple method that can be easily integrated into conventional evolutionary algorithms. In the proposed method, constraint weight represents the level of importance of each constraint, and enables evolutionary compliance prioritization. Moreover, an acceptable region, formed with constraint tolerances, allows trade-offs between objectives and constraints while preserving diverse solutions and improving optimization performance. These elements provide a tool for optimization problem designers in industry to construct their problems appropriately.
